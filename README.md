This tool is designed to help you memorize Scripture using visual and spatial cues rather than full text. Enter the Book, Chapter, and Verse, then (optionally) set a Start # if you are memorizing verses that don’t begin at verse 1. Click a grid cell to select it, then type letters on your keyboard or click the letter buttons to fill the grid. Use periods to mark natural phrase breaks—typing a period automatically moves you to the next row. The row readout at the bottom shows each verse line (V1, V2, etc.) using dots as memory cues, helping you recite the verse aloud without seeing the full text. You can print the page for offline practice, or export/import your work to save and restore progress later.
