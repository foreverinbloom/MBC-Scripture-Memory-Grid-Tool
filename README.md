# MBC-Scripture-Memory-Grid-Tool
This tool helps you memorize Scripture using visual and spatial cues instead of full text. Enter the Book, Chapter, and Verse, then fill the grid by typing or clicking letters. Use periods to mark phrase breaks. Dot cues help you recite without seeing the verse. Print or export/import to save progress.
